- 👋 Hi, I’m @dougvdotcom, aka Doug Vanderweide
- 👀 I’m interested in helping others learn how to code, how to sell and how to lead
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the time about everything; the world is full of wonder
- 💞️ I’m passionate about helping newer coders and consultants, because I needed all the help I could get and now it's my turn to give back
- 📫 The best way to reach me is by email, dougvanderweide@gmail.com
